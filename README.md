# Discord-DMChannel-Cleaner
Will delete all messages sent by you in a DMChannel, good for cleanup.

Add the ID of the DMChannels you want yourself gone from within the channels filled seperated by a comma.

Will automatically go through and delete any messages you sent in that channel, this repeats a few times due to it sometimes missing messages due to rate limit, this is a discord limitation.
